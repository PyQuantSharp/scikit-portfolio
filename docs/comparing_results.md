# Portfolio results comparison

In this section we explain how to compare different portfolio optimization methods based on different metrics and charts.

Take for example the following two algorithms: the minimum volatility portfolio versus the minimum MAD portfolio. What has the best out-of-sample performances?

To answer this question we initialize our data on the matlab dataset, made of 20,000 observations.
